# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites (once for a machine)
- Node Installation: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) [Recommended LTS version]

After successfully installing those dependencies, open this template with any IDE [[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended], and then open the internal terminal of IDE [VS Code shortcut <code>ctrl/cmd + \`</code>]

### Requirements

To follow along, you will need:

- Python 3.10 or higher. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org)
- An OpenAI API key. Sign up for an API key at [openai.com](https://www.openai.com)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ubayed-Bin-Sufian/AI-News-Hub.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd AI-News-Hub
   ```
   
3. Install dependencies, this can take a minute
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   
4. Start the local server
   ```
   npm start
   ```

Your browser should now open and show the app. Otherwise open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. Editing files will automatically refresh the page.

## Deployment

### Production Build
After finishing all the customization, you can create a production build by running this command.
```
npm run build 
```
It will create a folder named build with your compiled project inside. After that copy its content into your webroot and you are ready to go.

### Deployment using Vercel
- Login/Signup to the Vercel GitHub account.
- Authorize the repository access.
- Configure the custom domain on Vercel.
Go through the [website](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/deployment-methods) by Vercel team and learn deploying using Git.

## Built With
